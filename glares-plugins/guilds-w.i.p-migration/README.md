## Translations

In **Guilds**, we always try to support as many languages as we can in order to support more people! The plugin currently supports 20 languages, but not all of them are always up-to-date on the translations. If you speak a language fluently other than English and are interested in translating, please join our [discord](https://helpch.at/discord) and let us know so that we can give you information on how to do that!
