# Guilds \[W.I.P Migration]

![](../../.gitbook/assets/assets\_-ljvb1samgd8bcef8vll\_-ljvj\_mqe-jg2tyif8gr\_-ljvjczthyzhl1ezc3td\_logo.png)

## Description

**Guilds** were created to offer an RPG-type system to servers. It was inspired by players like you who enjoy creating a fun, exciting, and adventurous environment for your server. **Guilds** allow players to join interactive groups of other players, make their own communities on your server, and have a general fun time!

## **Features**

* Per-Guild Hierarchy (Roles)
* Tiers (Includes perks of your choosing)
* Claims (via WorldGuard)
* Banks
* Vaults (As many as your choose!)
* Buffs
* Per-Guild Chat
* Wars (via Arenas that you make)
* Multilingual
* **Tons** of GUIs!
* JSON + MySQL + SQLite support!

## Dependencies **(soft)**

* [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/34315/)
* [WorldGuard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard)
* [PlaceholderAPI](https://placeholderapi.com)
* [Essentials](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/9089/)

You can read more about the dependencies in the plugin on the next page, or by clicking [here](../../clips-plugins/deluxemenus/options-and-configurations/requirements.md).

## Supported Platforms

* Spigot
* Paper
* CatServer? (I'm leaving this here because I've been told by multiple sources that this plugin seems to be working on whatever this is).\
  \
  Note: I've been told this works on cracked servers to an extent but it is not tested, nor is it fully supported.

## Translations

In **Guilds**, we always try to support as many languages as we can in order to support more people! The plugin currently supports 20 languages, but not all of them are always up-to-date on the translations. If you speak a language fluently other than English and are interested in translating, please join our [discord](https://helpch.at/discord) and let us know so that we can give you information on how to do that!
