# External menus

## Creating a new menu

1. Open the config file `plugins/DeluxeMenus/config.yml`.  
2. Register the new menu by adding the following under the `gui_menus:` section:

> ```yaml
>   <MenuName>:
>     file: <FileName>.yml
> ```
>
> > * `<MenuName>` is the menu's name \(should be unique\) .
> > * `<FileName>` is the menu's file name, its preferred to use the menu's name to prevent confusion \(should be unique\).

So it will be like this:

```yaml
gui_menus:
  <MenuName>:
    file: <FileName>.yml
```

3. Reload DeluxeMenus plugin \(`/dm reload`\).  
4. The menu's file will be generated by the plugin and can be found in `gui_menus` folder \(`plugins/DeluxeMenus/gui_menus`\).  
5. You're done! Open the menu's file and modify it as you wish.

## Moving a menu from config to its own file

1. Open the config file `plugins/DeluxeMenus/config.yml`.  
2. Go to the menu part in the config and add the following line to it:

> ```yaml
>     file: <FileName>.yml
> ```
>
> > * `<FileName>` is the menu's file name, its preferred to use the menu's name to prevent confusion \(should be unique\).

So it will be like:

```yaml
  YourMenuName:
    file: <FileName>.yml
    menu_title: "Your Title"
    size: #
    # etc
```

3. Reload DeluxeMenus plugin \(`/dm reload`\).  
4. The new menu's file will be generated by the plugin and can be found in `gui_menus` folder \(`plugins/DeluxeMenus/gui_menus`\). Go and open it.  
5. Cut your menu's lines \(from the first line after the `file:` option you added in step 2 to the last line for the menu\) in the config file.  
6. Go to the menu's external file and replace the content of it with the menu's lines you cut from the config file \(from the previous step\).  
7. Remove 4 spaces before every line in the menu's external file. You can easily do this by selecting all the text in the file \(`CTRL` + `A`\) then press \(`CTRL` + `[`\) twice \(This way may not be supported in all text editors, such as Notepad++\).  
8. Reload DeluxeMenus plugin \(`/dm reload`\).  
9. You're done! The new file should look like this:

```yaml
menu_title: "Your Title"
size: #
# etc
```
