| Tag                 | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<delay=<time>>`    | Executes the action after the specified delay (in ticks, 20 ticks = 1 second).                                                                   |
| `<chance=<chance>>` | Sets a chance to execute the action. Can be from 0 to 100 where 0 means that the action will never execute and 100 means it will always execute. |

{% hint style="danger" %}
To note is that chance tags are per action. So if you have 2 action, both with a 50% chance, there won't be just 1 of the actions that execute but instead it will could be none, 1 or both.
{% endhint %}
