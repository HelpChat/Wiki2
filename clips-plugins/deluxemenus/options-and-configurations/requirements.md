# Requirements

{% hint style="warning" %}
**IMPORTANT!**\
**`left/right/shift_left/shift_right/middle`** click requirements won't work unless you also have their respective click commands. This is true even if you have set the **`success_commands`** option
{% endhint %}

Requirements allow you to restrict certain actions or even an entire menu and only allow certain players to see and/or use the menu.

## Requirements

| Type                                                                                       | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Open Requirement](gui.md#open-requirements)                                               | Defines the requirements to open the menu.                    |
| [View Requirement](item.md#view-requirement)                                               | Defines the requirements to see an item in the menu.          |
| [(Shift) Left/Right Click Requirements](item.md#shift-left-middle-right-click-requirement) | Defines the requirements to (shift) left/right click an item. |

{% hint style="info" %}
* Placeholders and [arguments](gui.md#args) can be used in the requirements.
* If you set multiple requirements, all of them should be met (Use [JavaScript type](requirements.md#javascript) or minimum\_requirements to add optional requirements).
{% endhint %}

## Requirement types

{% hint style="warning" %}
When inverting requirements, make sure you put the type in quotation marks. This is because "!" is a special symbol in YAML so it will break the syntax.

ex: `type: "!has permission"`
{% endhint %}

### **Has permission**

> ```yaml
> type: has permission
> permission: TEXT
> ```

Checks if the player has the specified permission.

To invert the requirement (Check if the player doesn't have the permission) you can simply add the exclamation mark before the type name (like this `type: "!has permission"`).

### **Has money**

> ```yaml
> type: has money
> amount: #
> ```

Checks if the player has the specified amount of money ([Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/34315/) is required).

To invert the requirement (Check if the player doesn't have the amount of money) you can simply add the exclamation mark before the type name (like this `type: "!has money"`).

{% hint style="info" %}
To use a placeholder as a value for the amount, replace the `amount:` field with `placeholder:`.
{% endhint %}

### **Has Item**

> ```yaml
> type: has item
> # material option supports material names, placeholders and arguments.
> material: "TEXT"
> data: #
> # represents the CustomModelData the item should have.
> modeldata: #
> amount: #
> name: "TEXT"
> # lore can also be one single string: lore: "TEXT"
> lore:
>   - "TEXT"
> # if this is enabled then the plugin will look for items that contain the value
> # set at the option "name" in their name and not for the exact value
> name_contains: boolean
> # if this option is enabled then the plugin will check for the item name,
> # without caring about the case.
> name_ignorecase: boolean
> # if this is enabled then the plugin will look for items that contain the value
> # set at the option "lore" in their lore and not for the exact value
> lore_contains: boolean
> # if this option is enabled then the plugin will check for the item lore,
> # without caring about the case.
> name_ignorecase: boolean
> # if this option is enabled, the plugin will consider only the items that 
> # have no custom model data, no display name and no lore.
> strict: boolean
> # decides if the plugin should also check the armor slots of the player when
> # looking for items
> armor: boolean
> # decides if the plugin should also check the off hand of the player when
> # looking for items
> offhand: boolean
> ```
>
> > **Required fields:**
> >
> > * Material

Checks if the player has the specified item in the inventory.

To invert the requirement (Check if the player doesn't have the item) you can simply add the exclamation mark before the type name (like this `type: "!has item"`).

### **Has Meta**

{% hint style="warning" %}
Meta uses Persistent Data Containers which means this feature will only work on servers that are 1.14 or newer!
{% endhint %}

> ```yaml
> type: has meta
> key: "TEXT"
> meta_type: <STRING, BOOLEAN, DOUBLE, LONG, INTEGER>
> value: EXPECTED VALUE
> ```
>
> > **Required fields:**
> >
> > * key
> > * meta\_type
> > * value

Checks if the player has the specified meta.

If the `meta_type` is a number format (DOUBLE, LONG, INTEGER) it will check if the player's meta value is greater than or equal to the `value`

To invert the requirement (Check if the input doesn't match the output) you can simply add the exclamation mark before the type name (like this `type: "!has meta"`).

### **Has Exp**

> ```yaml
> type: has exp
> amount: #
> level: boolean # true if you want to check for exp levels, false for exp points
> ```
>
> > **Required fields:**
> >
> > * amount

Checks if the player has the exp level or points.

If the `level` option does not exist, it will check for exp points by default

To invert the requirement (Check if the input doesn't match the output) you can simply add the exclamation mark before the type name (like this `type: "!has exp"`).

### **Is Near**

> ```yaml
> type: is near
> location: "WORLDNAME,X,Y,Z"
> distance: #
> ```
>
> > **Required fields:**
> >
> > * location
> > * distance

Checks if the player is within `distance` of `location`.

To invert the requirement (Check if the input doesn't match the output) you can simply add the exclamation mark before the type name (like this `type: "!is near"`).

### **JavaScript**

> ```yaml
> type: javascript
> expression: 'EXPRESSION'
> ```
>
> > **Example:**
> >
> > ```yaml
> > type: javascript
> > expression: '%vault_eco_balance% >= 100'
> > ```

Evaluates a JavaScript expression that must return true or false.

### **String Equals**

> ```yaml
> type: string equals
> input: "TEXT"
> output: "TEXT"
> ```
>
> > **Example:**
> >
> > ```yaml
> > type: string equals
> > input: "%server_name%"
> > output: "HelpChat"
> > ```

Checks if `input:` matches `output:` (Case sensitive).

To invert the requirement (Check if the input doesn't match the output) you can simply add the exclamation mark before the type name (like this `type: "!string equals"`).

### **String Equals Ignore Case**

> ```yaml
> type: string equals ignorecase
> input: "TEXT"
> output: "TEXT"
> ```
>
> > **Example:**
> >
> > ```yaml
> > type: string equals ignorecase
> > input: "%server_name%"
> > output: "helpchat"
> > ```

Checks if `input:` matches `output:` (Case insensitive).

To invert the requirement (Check if the input doesn't match the output) you can simply add the exclamation mark before the type name (like this `type: "!string equals ignorecase"`).

### **String Contains**

> ```yaml
> type: string contains
> input: "TEXT"
> output: "TEXT"
> ```
>
> > **Example:**
> >
> > ```yaml
> > type: string contains
> > input: "%server_name%"
> > output: "chat"
> > ```

Checks if `input:` contains `output:` (Case sensitive).

To invert the requirement (Check if the input doesn't contain the output) you can simply add the exclamation mark before the type name (like this `type: "!string contains"`).

### Regex matches

> ```yaml
> type: regex matches
> input: "TEXT"
> regex: "EXPRESSION"
> ```

Checks if `input:` contains the regular expression in `regex:`.\
Visit [this site](https://regexr.com/) to create regular expressions easily.

To invert the requirement (Check if the input doesn't contain the regular expression) you can simply add the exclamation mark before the type name (like this `type: "!regex matches"`).

### **Comparators**

> ```yaml
> type: (==, >=, <=, !=, >, <)
> input: #
> output: #
> ```

Compares `input:` with `output:`.

{% hint style="success" %}
Now both the input and the output support floating point values.
{% endhint %}

#### Available options

| Comparator | Description                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `==`       | `input:` equals to `output:`                 |
| `>=`       | `input:` greater than or equals to `output:` |
| `<=`       | `input:` less than or equals to `output:`    |
| `!=`       | `input:` not equals to `output:`             |
| `>`        | `input:` greater than `output:`              |
| `<`        | `input:` less than `output:`                 |
